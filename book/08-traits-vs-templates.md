## Why This Matters to a C++ Developer

Start by anchoring the topic in familiar C++ experience.

- What problem does this solve in C++?
- How is it usually handled today?
- Where do conventions, discipline, or tooling fill the gap?

Avoid Rust terminology here as much as possible.
This section should feel comfortable and familiar.

## The C++ Mental Model

Describe how a seasoned C++ developer *naturally* reasons about this concept.

- Typical idioms
- Common patterns
- Implicit assumptions
- Trade-offs C++ accepts

Use short code snippets **only if they clarify thinking**, not to teach syntax.

---

## Where the Model Breaks Down

Explain:
- What C++ allows that becomes fragile at scale
- What the compiler cannot prove
- Why bugs here are subtle, not obvious

Be fair to C++.
The goal is understanding — not criticism.
