# About the Author

Robin George Koshy has spent 12+ years writing systems-level C++ for automotive industry. The work involved the usual challenges: memory management, concurrency, performance optimization, and debugging crashes that only appeared in production.

Learning Rust meant unlearning assumptions about how compilers work. The borrow checker rejected patterns that had worked for years in C++. The frustration was real, but so was the realization that many of those patterns were fragile.

This book documents that learning process—not as a conversion story, but as a translation guide. Rust and C++ solve similar problems with different trade-offs. Understanding those trade-offs requires understanding both languages deeply.

The goal was to write the book that didn't exist when learning Rust: one that assumes you already know systems programming and just need to map your existing mental models to Rust's constraints.

If you've spent years with C++ and are evaluating Rust, this book is that map.
