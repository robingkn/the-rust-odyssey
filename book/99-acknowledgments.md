# Acknowledgments

This book exists because of work done by others.

The Rust project's documentation—particularly *The Rust Programming Language* by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols—provided the foundation. The Rust compiler's error messages taught more than any tutorial could.

The C++ community's decades of experience with memory safety, RAII, and zero-cost abstractions informed every comparison in this book. The problems Rust solves are problems C++ developers identified and documented long before Rust existed.

Engineers who reviewed early drafts caught technical errors and unclear explanations. Their skepticism improved the book.

The tools that made this possible: Rust's compiler, Cargo, rust-analyzer, and the standard library documentation. Markdown for writing. Git for version control.

To the developers who've debugged enough use-after-free bugs to appreciate what Rust prevents: this book is for you.
