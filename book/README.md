# The Rust Odyssey  
## A C++ Developer’s Journey

---

## Part I — Why Another Systems Language?

1. **Why Rust Exists (Through a C++ Lens)**  
   *The problems C++ never promised to solve*

2. **Hello World Without the Lies**  
   *What Rust actually asks of you from day one*

---

## Part II — Ownership Changes Everything

3. **Ownership: The Missing Concept in C++**  
   *From implicit conventions to explicit rules*

4. **Borrowing vs Aliasing**  
   *Why references are harder than they look*

5. **Lifetimes Without the Fear**  
   *Understanding the compiler instead of fighting it*

6. **RAII Reimagined**  
   *Deterministic destruction, made explicit*

---

## Part III — Expressiveness Without Cost

7. **Error Handling Without Exceptions**  
   *Making failure visible and composable*

8. **Traits vs Templates**  
   *Interfaces, generics, and intent*

9. **Zero-Cost Abstractions (For Real)**  
   *What the compiler guarantees—and what it doesn’t*

---

## Part IV — Power, Safety, and Reality

10. **Unsafe Rust for C++ Veterans**  
    *Crossing the boundary, responsibly*

11. **Concurrency Without Data Races**  
    *What happens when safety scales*

12. **When Rust Feels Hard — and Why**  
    *The honest trade-offs, and when they’re worth it*
