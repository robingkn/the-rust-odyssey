## Why This Matters to a C++ Developer

Start by anchoring the topic in familiar C++ experience.

- What problem does this solve in C++?
- How is it usually handled today?
- Where do conventions, discipline, or tooling fill the gap?

Avoid Rust terminology here as much as possible.
This section should feel comfortable and familiar.

## The C++ Mental Model

Describe how a seasoned C++ developer *naturally* reasons about this concept.

- Typical idioms
- Common patterns
- Implicit assumptions
- Trade-offs C++ accepts

Use short code snippets **only if they clarify thinking**, not to teach syntax.

---

## Where the Model Breaks Down

Explain:
- What C++ allows that becomes fragile at scale
- What the compiler cannot prove
- Why bugs here are subtle, not obvious

Be fair to C++.
The goal is understanding — not criticism.

---

## Rust’s Model

Explain how Rust approaches the same problem:

- What the Rust language enforces that differs from C++
- How Rust prevents subtle bugs or enforces constraints
- Trade-offs Rust makes versus C++

Include realistic, idiomatic Rust code examples:

## Takeaways for C++ Developers

- Concise summary of the differences and mental model adjustments
- Checklist or rules-of-thumb to guide Rust coding patterns
- Optional warnings about subtle pitfalls when translating C++ intuition
