# Phase 6 & 7 Completion Report

## Phase 6: Front Matter Creation ✓

Created five front matter files maintaining the book's established voice:

### Files Created:
1. **book/00-title-page.md** - Clean title page with book name, subtitle, and author placeholder
2. **book/00-copyright.md** - Standard copyright notice with educational disclaimer for code examples
3. **book/00-preface.md** - Explains book purpose, target audience (experienced C++ developers), and sets expectations about difficulty
4. **book/00-how-to-read-this-book.md** - Guides readers through chapter progression, emphasizes patience with early friction, discourages mechanical translation
5. **book/00-note-on-examples.md** - Clarifies that examples are small, focused, illustrative, and not production-ready

### Adherence to Constraints:
- No chapter summaries
- No new Rust concepts introduced
- No marketing language
- No overpromising outcomes
- Maintained calm, non-evangelical tone
- Respected experienced developer audience

## Phase 7: Copyedit & Formatting ✓

Performed comprehensive copyedit across all 12 chapters and 3 appendices.

### Changes Applied:

#### Language & Clarity:
- Improved sentence flow without changing technical meaning
- Removed minor redundancies
- Fixed punctuation consistency (parenthetical phrases, em dashes)
- Normalized phrasing patterns across chapters

#### Tone Consistency:
- Maintained experienced C++ developer voice throughout
- Ensured no tutorial or beginner phrasing
- Kept explanations precise and grounded
- Avoided emotional or persuasive language

#### Formatting Consistency:
- Verified consistent Markdown heading levels
- Checked code block formatting
- Ensured consistent use of emphasis (bold for section headers)
- Normalized punctuation in lists and explanations

#### Code Presentation:
- All code blocks remain readable and minimal
- Comments preserved where they add value
- Code aligns with surrounding explanations
- No unnecessary verbosity added

### Specific Edits Made:
- Normalized parenthetical phrasing (e.g., "adversarial (at first)" → "adversarial at first")
- Improved clarity in technical descriptions
- Tightened wordy constructions
- Ensured consistent terminology across chapters
- Fixed minor grammatical issues

### Files Edited:
- All 12 main chapters (01-12)
- All 3 appendices (A, B, C)
- No structural changes made
- No technical semantics altered
- No examples added or removed
- No nuance or caveats removed

## Verification:

✓ Front matter matches book tone and audience
